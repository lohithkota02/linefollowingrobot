In the realm of robotics and automation, the development of intelligent systems capable of navigating dynamic environments has long been an important point of focus. One such application is the design and making of a line-following robotâ€”a versatile machine tasked with autonomously tracking and sticking to a designated path showed by a contrasting line.
The fundamental objective of this project is to design and make a sophisticated line-following robot equipped with sensors and algorithms that enable it to detect, interpret, and respond to variations in the line's direction in real-time. Additionally, the robot possesses the intelligence to take decisions instantly to maintain its trajectory along the predefined path while being able to identify and stop in the presence of obstacles in its route.
